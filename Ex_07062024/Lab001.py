# take the 2 inputs from the user and we have to add them
# we need to use the input function for user actions

num1=input("Enter the 1st number")
num2=input("Enter the 2nd number")

# type conversion we need to use string->intiger= intiger
result=int(num1)+int(num2)
print(result)

# note:
# + means it will do 2 things
#
# if it is numbers than it ll add it and give the result as sum
#
# if it is string it will concatinate and will the result as combining two
#
# ex:int
# 10+10=20
# ex:stg
# 10+20=1020
