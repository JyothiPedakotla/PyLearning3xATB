#tuple is also collection of list but it is a immutable in nature that means we cannot change the value
#tuple represents in()


my_list=(1,23,78,100,100)
print(my_list)

#output
# (1, 23, 78, 100,100)

# my_list[4]=25
# print(my_list)

# in above 2 line its giving error like we cannot change the valuses in tuple list
