# 1.	Explain the difference between the = operator and the = = operator in Python.
# 2.	What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?
# 3.	What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?

# 1.Explain the difference between the = operator and the = = operator in Python.
# '=' assignment operator is used to assigne the value.
#  '= =' comparison operator is used to compare the value between two data.

# ======================================================================================

# 2.What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?
# '**' this operator is used to raise to the power of any number
# Example : 5**2= 25,  6**2= 36 , 2**2=4, 2**3=8

# ======================================================================================

# 3.What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?
#The ^ operator in Python performs a bitwise XOR operation between two numbers. It returns 1 for bits that are different and 0 for bits that are the same.
# or
##^ bitwise XOR operator
# it will perform the operation XOR operations in between 2 numbers

#Ex:
a=5   #101 in binary
b=3  # 011 in binary
print(a^b) #output:6

# calculation

# 5= 101
# 3= 011
#---------
#     1 1 0
# outpout:6 =>  110
